CryptoSorter 
#   This was written in response the the awful CryptoLocker virus
#   While it is not able to decrypt files it automatically sorts the of
#   The file types that CryptoLocker attacks. Any unencrypted files are
#   then moved to a user specified directory. It is recommended to run this
#   offline through a linux distribution due to the worm like nature of 
#   the virus so as to prevent further infection
